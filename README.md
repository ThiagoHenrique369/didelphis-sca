Haedus Toolbox SCA

Samantha F McCabe, 2015

The Haedus Toolbox SCA is a powerful, script-driven sound-change applier program implemented in Java. It supports UTF-8 natively and has a rule syntax designed for clarity and similarity to sound change notation in linguistics.

The Haedus SCA supports capabilities like multiple rule conditions, regular expressions, metathesis, unrestricted variable naming, and scripting but also allows novice users to ignore advanced functionality they do not need.
